          In Spring 2020, just at the beginning of the Corona Virus pandemic, I
          started out on a new kind of creative journey. I got myself a gravel
          bike. And in early 2023, I rediscovered my passion for film
          photography. This blog a documentation of the intersection of these
          two mediums.
          <br /><br />I want to share here some of my impressions since then. It
          is my hope not to make this a very thic documentation of my creative
          process, but it should have an understandable structure and logic.
          <br /><br />Therefore, this website has a few sections that interlap
          each other, while others are independant. Some will be follow a
          narrative style; others will be more perseptive and/or interpretative.
          <br /><br />This picture on the right was taken in summer 2023 while
          on a tour of east Bielefeld along the river Lutter.

          I'm not one for validation of religion. But spirituality is something
          that we all can experience. I guess, I've had my fair share of
          spirituality in a non-religious sense. Don't worry, this is not a
          space for religious chatter. What it is about, is a creative
          expression of what spirituality sometimes results in. <br /><br />
          Starting out as a student of philosophical investigations of our
          consciousness, spirituality fascinated me quite a bit. I've been
          careful not to let my personal opinions come in the way of my creative
          process of writing, but shall we say it isn't always easy.
