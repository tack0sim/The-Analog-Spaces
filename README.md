Hi there!

This is my first website project as I learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It is a work in progress and I try my best to document my workflow as well as the mistakes.
My methods improve over time and I learn from my peers.
Please leave your suggestions, comments or critiques. And I will be very happy to incorporate
these in my project.

Thanks for your visit!
